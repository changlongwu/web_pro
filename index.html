        <p>The digital divide is a problem that affects people from all walks of life. It is a multifaceted issue, but two main characteristics define this gap: access to high-speed internet and access to reliable devices. </p>

                <h3>At Home</h3>
                <p>In some areas, internet access is either limited, unavailable, or unaffordable for those who could be equipped. This leaves countless students and professionals to rely on public computers or their mobile devices as their only tools to exist in an increasingly digital world. </p>

                <h3>At School</h3>
                <p>In K-12 settings, a digital divide is commonly seen when students have limited or no internet access at home. Students from low-income families can also struggle to have devices like laptops or tablets which are often necessary tools, especially as STEAM education becomes a wider focus in K-12 curricula. </p>

                <h3>At Work</h3>
                <p>Those who experience the digital divide in earlier life can feel the effects well into their career. The digital divide often means the difference between an individual having the training and experience they need or missing the opportunity to hone their skills and further their education.</p>

                    <p>Imagine a family of five sharing one cellphone to access the Internet. Or children within the same household ranging from elementary to high school, sharing one computer and Internet connection for online learning? The pandemic has shown us that the Digital Divide still exists and persists for those with low incomes, including many seniors. While progress has been made, Pew Research reports that 35% of US households with school children and incomes at or below $30,000 still lack Internet access. Internet access is no longer a luxury, but a 21st century right. We ask that you join us by signing this petition in support of a Digital Equity Bill of Rights.</p>
